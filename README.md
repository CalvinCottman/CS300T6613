# What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
The problem we were solving was what method should you use to organize data structures and why. The projects in this course mainly revolved around data structures and organizing them. We learned a few different methods of organizing the data structures as well as how to create a data structure. Another big factor in this class was runtime analysis, and which methods of organization were best for it's scenario. There are a bunch of different methods to use but each has it's own pros and cons. It was important to understand why someone would use one method over another.

# How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
I approached the problem by analyzing why each method of organization we learned was a good or not good method to use in this specific case of organizing. We were given two different CSV's. One CSV has about 76 lines of data where each line gave details of each data structure. The other CSV has close to 18,000. It was important to recognize that we would be using alot of memory and data in these projects and therefor it was important to figure out how to maximize efficiency in our method of organization.

# How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
Most of my roadblocks I solved by using the 24/7 tutor availible at SNHU. A few times I didn't even make it to get help from the tutor before I realized what my problem was. It is always important to look at every detail of your code, and alot of my mistakes were small things that were hard to catch. Maybe a typo or maybe I was trying to call a variable in the wrong way. A second set of eyes, or even some time away from the code and look at the code with a fresh set of eyes helps alot.

# How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
Not only do I now have a better understanding of data structures, but I also left this course with a better understanding of classes in C++ and how to use them within a class. It was a bit hard in the beggining because I had one understanding of a class and really had not had too much experience using a class within a class. 

# How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I learned a lot of great methods of organization. These methods I do not have to know by heart, but as long as I understand how and why they work I can use them with confidence. Also my main code has become alot cleaner through this class. I can use the code I wrote in this class in many areas of coding. If I am ever in a situation where I need to organize data, these codes can help keep my data organized and easy to search for data, remove data, and enter new data in.
